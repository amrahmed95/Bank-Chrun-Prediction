## Bank Churn Prediction using ML.

This project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict customer churn in banking. By cleaning and extracting relevant features from historical data, it identifies patterns indicative of customer attrition. Through the development and testing of predictive models, banks gain valuable insights to proactively address customer retention, ensuring long-term satisfaction and loyalty


#### Business Problem

In the world of banking, one of the biggest challenges is keeping customers happy and staying with the bank. It's way cheaper to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. But sometimes, customers decide to leave, and banks want to know why. That's where this project comes in. We're using smart computer methods to figure out when customers might leave.

We start by looking at all the data the bank has collected over time. Then, we clean it up and identify the most important parts. We use data cleaning to ensure the information is accurate and ready for analysis. After that, we employ clever techniques like feature engineering to extract the most useful bits of data. This helps us uncover patterns and trends that might predict if a customer will leave or not.

Once we've got everything prepared, we're building machine learning models using simple but effective methods to predict which customers might leave the bank. But we're not stopping there. We're also testing these models with separate data to ensure their efficiency. By doing all this, we hope to provide banks with the tools they need to keep their customers happy and loyal for the long haul.
